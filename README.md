<h1> FOOD SUGGESTER <h1>
This is the mini project for the MU Computer (sem4) for subject OSTL.

<h3>Idea<h3>
 <p>I live in the hostel. Most of the time we order food from the online sites like Zomato/Swiggy. But since there are lot of options available, we end up wasting hours deciding what to order. To resolve this issue I created this simple project which lets user decide food intuitively.</p>
